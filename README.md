# Resturant Food Management App

This app display a restaurants menu completely dynamically when we add food to the database.
It is all done using class views, jinja and dynamic urls. 

The food items are crossed out based on there availability and clicking on an item will land us to a details page, which fetches data from the database and displays it on the page.
